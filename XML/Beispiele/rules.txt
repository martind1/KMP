Names can contain letters, numbers, and other characters 
Names must not start with a number or punctuation character 
Names must not start with the letters xml (or XML or Xml ..) 
Names cannot contain spaces 

Non-English letters like йтб are perfectly legal in XML element names, but watch out for problems if your software vendor doesn't support them.

The ":" should not be used in element names because it is reserved to be used for something called namespaces (more later).

Attribute values must always be enclosed in quotes, but either single or double quotes can be used.
