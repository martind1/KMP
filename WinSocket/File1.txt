Let's say you have a client/server application that you
want to communicate between.  A simple way to do so is the following
using an 'extract' function.
Create a form with TClientSocket and another with TServerSocket.
Let's say you want the server to 'delete' a file when it
receives a certain string.  You would call the following from
a OnClientRead event (which I call ServerSocketClientRead in the sample).

(the TClientSocket must first send this)
<<CodeBegins here>>
//below we send a string the server will recognize followed
//by the filename to be deleted on the server (full path+file)

ClientSocket1.Socket.SendText ('delfile'+OpenDialog1.Filename); 
                                                               
(TServerSocket retreives buffer)

procedure TServerForm.ServerSocketClientRead(Sender: TObject;
  Socket: TCustomWinSocket);
var gotstr:string;
begin
gotstr:=socket.receivetext;
 if copy (gotstr, 1, 7)='delfile' then
  begin
   DeleteFile (extract (gotstr, 8, Length(gotstr))); 
  end;
end;

//Dont forget to declare the 'extract' function

function extract (st: string; ind1, ind2 : integer): string;
  var i: integer;
 begin
  result:='';
  for i:=ind1 to ind2 do
   result:=result+st[i];
 end;

((((END CODE)))
Hope that was explained well enough.  Sorry if it was not ...
